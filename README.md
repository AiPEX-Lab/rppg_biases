The 'Data' folder contains the video data of subjects from India and Sierra Leone. As the participants have given permission for their de-indentified video data to be shared publicly, we generated 3 videos from each subject video. The 3 videos generated for each subject are:

1) Rectangular region of 60 x 30 pixels of the forehead 
2) Rectangular region of 25 x 25 pixels of the left cheek (the left of the viewer)
3) Rectangular region of 25 x 25 pixels of the right cheek (the right of the viewer)

The ground truth mean heart rate for each video is provided in the respective '.csv' files contained in the 'Ground_Truth' folder.
